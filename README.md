# Password Random Generator

## Description
This is a java project that creates a random password of 16 characters. The possible character could be uppercase or lowercase letter along with numbers 0-9 and symbols !@#$%^&*()_-|. This is considered a strong password and will be generated uniquly each time the java file is ran. This is meant to be a quick command line script to run whenever you need to create a new password. At this moment there is no way to store the password unless you want to write each one down on a piece of paper that you use. 

## User Usage
IN order to use this, follow the installation guide to install the script. From there, you want to navigate in your command line interface to where the folder has installed. After you want to run '''javac Password.java''' This will compile the Password.java file and then from there all you have to do is run the file. To do this you need to run '''bash java Password.java''' and this will create a unique passwod. Once you have ran the javac command once, you will not need to run it again. Any time you need a password just run the '''bash java Password.java''' command and you get a new strong password every time. 
## Installation
In order to install download the files into a folder that you can access from your command line. You can title the folder whatever you want but ensure that the names of the files stay the same. Once you run the javac command above, you will have another two class files generated which are the compiled versions of the classes (keep those).
